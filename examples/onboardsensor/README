This example demonstrate acquisition of the analog onboard sensor
and print the result on the usb/UART..
to switch between luminosity APDS or CTN temperature measurement
comment the line in onbardsensor.c
 
* Luminosity sensor APDS measurement 
for significant measurement use all the LED off
so modify the >platform>wismote>contiki-main.c
by comment this 
  //  leds_on(LEDS_GREEN);
after the initialization sequence instructions

be carefull : power consumption not optimized.. chip power gpio always activated
